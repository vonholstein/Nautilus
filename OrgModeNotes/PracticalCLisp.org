** Self Evaluating Object - Eg 10
*** Is an object that evaluates to itself
* Chapter 3
+ list, property list alias plist
+ Property list is created with format (value :symbolname value :symbolname repeat)
+ keyword symbol - any name that starts with a colon
+ function getf returns value associated with symbol in a plist
+ Lisp naming convention for defining global variables - *variable-name*
+ use push macro to add items to a list
** Format string
+ format used to print - (format stream formatstring varargs)
+ t is shortand for *standard-output*
+ Various directives available for use within format string
  - ~a : aesthetic directive, consumes one argument and outputs it in human readable form.
  - ~t : tabulation, eg ~10t emits enough spaces to move to the tenth column before processing the next ~a, does not conumse nay arguments
  - ~{ : next argument consumed must be a list, format loops over list processing directives between ~{ and ~}
** User Interaction
+ *query-io* is the stream argument to format for io
+ force-output function: necessary in some lisp implementations to ensure that Lisp doesn't wait for a newline before printing prompt
+ read-line function: returns string read (without trailing newline)
+ Test line at the end
